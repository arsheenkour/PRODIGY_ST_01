## Overview
This repository contains comprehensive test cases for a basic calculator application that performs fundamental arithmetic operations. The test suite is designed to verify the calculator's functionality across a wide range of inputs, ensuring reliable performance in real-world scenarios.

## ✅ Supported Operations
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (×)
- Division (÷)

## 📋 Test Coverage
Our test cases thoroughly examine the calculator's behavior with:

### 📊 Input Types
- Positive numbers
- Negative numbers
- Decimal values
- Large numbers
- Zero

### 🔄 Operation Combinations
- Order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS rule)
- Multiple operators in sequence
- Expression evaluation

### 🚨 Edge Cases
- Division by zero
- Invalid character inputs
- Floating-point precision issues
- Boundary value analysis
- Overflow and underflow scenarios

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arsheenkour/PRODIGY_ST_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_ST_01
   ```

2. Review the test cases in the repository to understand the testing approach

3. Apply these test cases to your own calculator implementation to ensure robustness

## 📝 Test Structure
Each test case follows this format:
- **Test ID**: Unique identifier for the test
- **Description**: What the test is verifying
- **Input**: The expression or values provided to the calculator
- **Expected Output**: The correct result that should be produced
- **Test Type**: Identifies whether it's a standard case or edge case

## 🛠️ Best Practices
The test suite demonstrates several testing best practices:
- Comprehensive input validation
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning
- Error handling verification
- Performance considerations

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Adding test cases for additional mathematical functions (square root, exponents, etc.)
- Performance testing for complex calculations
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Automated test execution frameworks

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions to expand the test suite are welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request with additional test cases or improvements to existing ones.
